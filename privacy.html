If you have chosen to receive communications by email from us but later wish to opt out of receiving such communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so included in the emails. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Site, such as service announcements or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2.2 Disclosure Regarding Service Providers</strong><br>Diginary Holdings contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, sending out information, and analyzing the Site. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2.3 Disclosures In Connection With Acquisitions Or Divestitures</strong><br>Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Diginary Holdings decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its own or other businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal and other information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Diginary Holdings’ practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. In the event that Diginary Holdings or all of its assets are acquired in such a transaction, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2.4 Disclosure For Other Reasons</strong><br>We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.</p></div></div></div></div>
